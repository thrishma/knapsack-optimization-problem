Problem statement : Given a Knapsack of a maximum capacity of W and N items each with its own value and weight, come up with an optimized model to throw in items inside the Knapsack such that the final contents has the maximum value. Use Gurobi library and C++ to program. 
Use decision variabes, set constraints, set an objective function and run the optimized model for results. 

Here I have considered 3 knapsacks of capacity 3,8 and 5 correspondingly and 3 items of 4,6 and 5 weights. The result of the optimised model is - knapsack of capacity 8 holds one item of weight 6 to provide the best optimal solution for the given problem statement.


Instructions on how to run the project - 
1. Open Visual Studio
2. Please do the required gurobi setup on it
3. Open the 'assignment' project in visual studio by selecting - "assignment.sln" 
   file which is present in the assignment folder.
4. Build the solution
5. Run the local debugger
